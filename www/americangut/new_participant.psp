    <li><h4>Purpose and Background</h4>
    <p>Trillions of microorganisms live on and within the human body, which is colonized at birth and continuously inhabited throughout a person’s lifetime. Our resident microbes occupy many body habitats, including the skin and mucosal surfaces, and the gastrointestinal tract. Our microbial symbionts are largely harmless or beneficial; for example, we rely on our gut microbiota to aid in nutrition, resist pathogens, and educate our immune system.  We would like to survey a large number of volunteers from the US and other countries including all body types, all dietary preferences and both healthy and unhealthy people to more clearly define the range of these microbial communities.  We are interested in learning whether people with similar age, diet, environment, family, pets, body weight, or other features, also have similar microorganisms.</p>
    <p>To accomplish this we will ask you to sample up to 7 sites on your body (skin anywhere on the body, saliva, stool, nostril mucus, vaginal mucus, ear wax or tears) using polyester tipped swabs that will be sent to you at the address you provide with instructions on how to obtain the samples, instructions for safely returning the samples to us and a pre-addressed envelope for returning the samples to us through FedEx or the mail service. You will also be asked to complete the questionnaire online that includes questions about age, diet, environment, family, pets, body weight and current health status.  You will be asked to use a website to determine your average intake of fat, protein, carbohydrates, vegetables and grains for 7 days prior to sampling.  The samples will have a code label attached to them so that we can identify who sent them to us but no personally identifying information. Some people may be asked to keep a food diary detailing everything they eat and drink every day for up to 6 months.  We may also request additional samples from certain participants that are of particular interest because of their health status and/or dietary preferences (a maximum of 7 times).  We anticipate that the entire study will be completed in 5 years. When the results are available for your samples we will provide you with an easy to understand summary of the microbial communities of your body and a summary of the combined results of other participants for comparison.  We anticipate that the results for your samples will be available within 3-6 months of receipt in the laboratory. These results will be sent to you by email. </p>
    <p>We are requesting that you contribute funding to the project at a level that is commensurate with the number of swabs and the kinds of tests you are requesting.  The basic package covers a single fecal swab.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Study Tasks and Procedures</h4>
        <p>If you agree to participate in this study you will be asked for your name ,  and to donate samples, to complete a questionnaire and to provide updated personal information. We will send you a sample kit that includes the swabs (which are individually wrapped in plastic and include a plastic sleeve for returning the sample to us), coded labels for the sample tubes, and a pre-addressed envelope with instructions on how to safely  return the samples to us for analysis.  
            <p>Samples may include:  
                <ol>
                    <li>Stool (fecal) by collecting a smear from used bathroom tissue using a sterile polyester-tip swab</li>
                    <li>Saliva using a sterile polyester-tip swab inserted into the mouth and sampling the surface of the tongue or inside of your cheek</li>
                    <li>Skin using a sterile polyester-tip swab</li>
                    <li>Nostril mucus by inserting a sterile polyester-tip swab gently into a nostril</li>
                    <li>Vaginal mucus by inserting a sterile polyester-tip swab into the introitus of the vagina</li>
                    <li>Ear wax by inserting a sterile polyester-tip swab gently into the ear</li>
                    <li>Tears by inserting a sterile polyester-tip swab gently along the inner corner of the eyelid (avoiding contact with the eye).</li></ol>
                    <p>Examples of areas of skin that may be swabbed include the forehead, and left and right palms.</p></p>
        <p>After you submit your first set of samples, we may ask you to donate additional samples (up to 7 times) if you belong to a group that has specific diet, disease or age considerations.  You will be contacted by email if we would like to repeat the sampling. Some participants will be asked to provide a detailed food diary that includes a list of everything you eat and drink every day for up to 6 months. If this is required we will contact you by email to confirm that you are willing to contribute this information.</p>
        <h5>International Participants</h5>
        <p>In order to comply with amended federal regulations and IATA regulations we are requesting that international participants return their sample tubes through FedEx international and follow additional requirements for safely shipping human swab samples.  You will need to use the airway bill we send to you  for shipment that clearly identifies the samples as “human exempt specimens”.  The samples will be packaged with secondary containment to ensure that they can be safely returned.  For this you will use tape to seal the plastic tube that contains the swab, place the swab in a buff mailing envelope and place the buff envelope inside the Tyvek/plastic mailer prior to FedEx shipment.  If you do not follow these directions the sample will be intercepted at the port of entry into the USA and destroyed.</p>

        <h5>Description of Surveys/Questionnaires/Interview Questions</h5>
        <p>You will be asked questions about your general personal information (age, sex, height, weight, ethnicity, place of birth, current ZIP code. We will ask if you recently moved and where you moved from., We will ask questions about general diet information (including whether you follow a special diet, if you have food allergies, whether you have cultural or religious food restrictions). Other questions address whether you have pets and the type of contact you have with these pets and your relationship to other people in this study.  There is a section on health information including a history of allergies/asthma, if you suffer from migraines and if you have a history of irritable bowel disease.  The questionnaire also asks you to complete a food log to assess the amount of protein, fat, carbohydrate, grains and vegetables in your diet. For this we suggest that you contact a free website that will allow you to estimate these amounts.</p>
        <p>Some participants may be asked to keep a detailed food diary for up to 6 months listing all the foods they eat and drink in a day.</p>
    
    <li><h4>Duration</h4>
        <p>We anticipate that participant time commitment for sampling will be less than 15 minutes; to complete the questionnaire online will take no more than 45 minutes; and completing the food diary should take no more than10 minutes/day.  The study will be conducted over a maximum period of 5 years to include all the people we are requesting permission to sample.  We anticipate that results will be available within 3-6 months of sample receipt.</p>
